# Landing Page Assignment GreedyGame

## üë®‚Äçüíª Live Demo

Try out the website : [Landing Page GreedyGame](https://greedygame-seven.vercel.app/)

## Features:

- Fully responsive website.
- A validation to visitor's contact information form which triggers clicking on .
- Added a sticky form and sticky navbar on desktop view.
- Added a footer navigation for finding the form with a smooth scroll effect in mobile view.

## Decisions:

- I use tailwind css to create that website to create it fast
- Try to use reusable elements
- maximum time I create a araay and using map function I iterate that
- organized file structure
- required images in public folder for accessibility to the images
- remove unnecessary file items
- I use direct svg to create that website

## Assumptions:

- Try to optimize the website
- Lighthouse report pretty good
